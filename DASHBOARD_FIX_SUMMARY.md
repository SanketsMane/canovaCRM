## âœ… DASHBOARD FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED

### ðŸ”§ **Issues Fixed:**

1. **Routing Problem**: 
   - **Issue**: AppLayout had nested routing that conflicted with App.js routing
   - **Fix**: Converted AppLayout to a layout wrapper component that accepts children
   - **Result**: Admin routes now properly render dashboard content

2. **Missing Dependency**: 
   - **Issue**: `react-icons` was not installed but required for dashboard icons
   - **Fix**: Installed react-icons package (`npm install react-icons`)
   - **Result**: StatsCard icons now display properly

3. **Component Structure**: 
   - **Issue**: Dashboard components weren't being rendered within AppLayout
   - **Fix**: Updated App.js to render Dashboard/Leads/Employees/Settings as children of AppLayout
   - **Result**: Full admin dashboard functionality restored

### ðŸ“Š **Dashboard Components Restored:**

âœ… **StatsCard**: Shows 4 key metrics with FontAwesome icons
- Unassigned Leads
- Leads Assigned This Week  
- Active Salespeople
- Conversion Rate

âœ… **SalesAnalytics**: Interactive bar chart using Recharts
- Daily sales data
- Custom tooltips with cumulative sales
- Responsive design

âœ… **RecentActivity**: Activity feed showing recent actions
- Lead assignments
- Employee additions
- Status updates

âœ… **EmployeesTable**: Employee management table
- Employee list with status

- Sortable columns

### ðŸŽ¯ **Current State:**

- âœ… Role-based authentication working
- âœ… Toast notifications working
- âœ… Admin dashboard fully functional with charts/data
- âœ… Employee dashboard accessible at /employee-home
- âœ… Protected routes enforcing role access
- âœ… All original dashboard functionality restored

### ðŸ§ª **Test the Fix:**

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Select "Admin" role
3. Login: `olivia.williams@canovacrm.com` / `admin123`
